# Rationale:
#
# - List all issues raised during the formal review in a concise manner.
#
# - The appearance of an item on this list does not necessarily mean it is accepted as a TODO item. 
#   This decision will be made later 
#
#
# File format:
#
# - Each item has a unique id of the form: ITnnn.
#
# - Each item references relevant posts(s).
#
# - Several issues may be grouped into a single item, if they are likely to be accepted/rejected as a group.

Document the differences (boost::any vs. boost::variant).

tutorial.html:
- a_printer and inst are not defined.
- chacne -> chance
- The next code snip, demonstrate -> The next code snip demonstrates

sample.html:
- What is the weight of a star or space ship?  Totaling mass would make more sense to me. :-)
- In the "bad" space example, total_weight's functions should return int.
- Switching between using and not using the static_visitor base class was confusing to me.  (I didn't notice it at first and was confused as to why result_type was defined sometimes but not others.)

reference.html:
- "All members of variant satisfy the strong guarantee of exception-safety, unless otherwise specified."  This is inharmonious with the unqualified claim in the into "Strong exception-safety guarantee for all operations."
- If check() is true - operator() -> If check() is true, operator() [otherwise, it looks like subtraction].
- It would be helpful to document the space usage of the current implementation.  Something like "pointer + 2 * sizeof(largest type) + padding" would be fine (assuming I have deduced correctly).

The documentation needs to describe when this reference is invalidated.

I'd like to be able to compile it with my compiler (BCC551)


== IT5 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44057.php]

a) In the introduction appears the term 'inhomogeneous'; isn't the term
'heterogeneous' a much more familiar synonym?

e) The visitation examples mismatches 'print_int_float_visitor'
with 'print_int_char_visitor'


== IT6 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44057.php]

The docs says that at least two parameters should be supplied.
This isn't true.
In fact, the implementation itself uses variants of a single parameter.

== IT7 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44057.php]

The docs don't mention at all the possibility of using an mpl
seuqence as the type set. Even if this is a restricted feature
-for those good compilers-, it should be mentioned because it's
most useful.


== IT8 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44057.php]

f) In the Visitor concept docs, it says:
   ...a function object which unambiguously accepts any value of
   each of the variant's bounded types...

First, I think this description is too informal, it itsn't clear if the
visitor must have overloads for all of the types _separately_,
or if the arguments must be passed by (const) reference, etc...
Perhaps something like:

   ...a function object whith an overloaded set of function call operators
   such that any value of each and all of the variant's bounded types
   can be passed to one of the operators unambiguosly, probably
   requireing an implicit conversion.

Support for 'void' as one of the types with the corresponding change in 'empty()' semantics.


== IT10 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44057.php]

a) static_visitable seems to be needed/useful for visitable-types, yet
it is undocumented.


== IT11 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44057.php]

'which' and realated is inconsistently typed


== IT12 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44015.php]

which() is documented to return "int", when the implementation returns
  "unsigned int".


== IT13 ==

[http://lists.boost.org/MailArchives/boost/msg44015.php]

Nowhere is it documented that using incomplete<T> as a type will result in
values of type T being stored on the heap, whereas values of other types are
stored within the variant itself

Requirement of BoundedTypes should state that references are not allowed

Fix VC7 warning  - unreferenced variable -  as follows (Courtesy of Ed Brey + Jason Shirk):

struct destroyer
: public static_visitor<>
{
 public: // visitor interfaces
  template <typename T>
  void operator()(const T& operand) const
  {
    operand; // C4100 workaround
    operand.~T();
  }
};

I ran across some errors in the code shown in the documentation
for the "first variant program."

In addition, compiling with Intel C++ 7.0 under strict ansi compliance
(-ansi) revealed the following nits as well:

aligned_storage.hpp(70):
error #308: type "boost::aligned_storage<size_, alignment_>::align_t [with
size_=28U, alignment_=4U]" is inaccessible
(I believe this is because the nested classes/unions have no special
access to private members of the enclosing class.
I added a friend declaration and union declaration to fix this.
